# TO-DO-List

Welcome to my first frontend project! This Todo List is my beginner-level attempt at frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Created with the help of tutorials from YouTube, it's a simple yet practical project aimed at learning the basics of web development.

Feel free to explore the code and add or remove tasks as you like. Thank you for checking out my repository as I begin my journey into frontend development!
